# travel-at-style
Project Description:
eCommerce platform for a New York based store focusing on travel apparel and hand-held steamer irons.

My Role in the Project:
Sole designer and developer from conceptualization to execution. T@S is my first more complex extracurricular Bootstrap/JavaScript project. It took 2 months of sporadic work to finish it, but it was all worth it because it has all the functionalities it was intended to have.

Technologies Used:
• HTML • CSS • Bootstrap • Jquery • JavaScript • PHP
